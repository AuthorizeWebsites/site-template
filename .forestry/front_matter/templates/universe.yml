  default: <p>Middle-earth is the fictional setting of much of the English writer
    J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term <em>Midgard</em>
    of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, that is, the central
    continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past.</p><p>Tolkien's
    most widely read works, <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>,
    are set entirely in Middle-earth; "Middle-earth" has also become a short-hand
    for the legendarium and Tolkien's fictional take on the world.</p><p>Middle-earth
    is the main continent of Earth (<em>Arda</em>) in an imaginary period of the Earth's
    past with the end of the Third Age about 6,000 years ago.</p>
