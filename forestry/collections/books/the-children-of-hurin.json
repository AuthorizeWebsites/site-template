  "description": "<p><em>The Children of Húrin</em> is the first complete book by J.R.R.Tolkien since the 1977 publication of <em>The Silmarillion</em>. Six thousand years before the One Ring is destroyed, Middle-earth lies under the shadow of the Dark Lord Morgoth. The greatest warriors among elves and men have perished, and all is in darkness and despair. But a deadly new leader rises, Túrin, son of Húrin, and with his grim band of outlaws begins to turn the tide in the war for Middle-earth—awaiting the day he confronts his destiny and the deadly curse laid upon him.<br><br>The paperback edition of <em>The Children of Húrin</em> includes eight color paintings by Alan Lee and a black-and-white map.</p>",
