  "description": "<p>Middle-earth is the fictional setting of much of the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term <em>Midgard</em> of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, that is, the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past.</p><p>Tolkien's most widely read works, <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, are set entirely in Middle-earth; \"Middle-earth\" has also become a short-hand for the legendarium and Tolkien's fictional take on the world.</p><p>Middle-earth is the main continent of Earth (<em>Arda</em>) in an imaginary period of the Earth's past with the end of the Third Age about 6,000 years ago.</p><p>Tolkien's Middle-earth stories mostly focus on the north-west of the continent. This part of Middle-earth is suggestive of Europe, the north-west of the Old World, with the environs of the Shire intended to be reminiscent of England (more specifically, the West Midlands, with Hobbiton set at the same latitude as Oxford).</p>",
